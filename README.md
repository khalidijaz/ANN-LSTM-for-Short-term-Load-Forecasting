# ANN-LSTM-for-Short-term-Load-Forecasting
This project presents a novel Short Receptive Field based Dilated Causal Convolutional Network Integrated with Bidirectional LSTM (SRDCC-BiLSTM) for Short-term electrical load forecasting. The presented model is compared with various statistical,machine learning and deep learning methods. This repository contains the codes related to this project

Download the ZIP folder from Github repository and extract it.
# For Jupter Notebook Files:
1. Place the extracted folder in the directory of Jupyter notebook.
2. After accessing the Jupyter interface, click on the extracted folder
3. After accessing the folder, five sub-folders will be found. The “Data” folder consists of Electrical Load Dataset.
Choose the desired "Multi-step DL Models" OR "Single-Step DL Models" to excute/run for forecasting purpose.
Choose the relevant algorithm's folder and open the FILES (.ipynb) present in that folder.
Run the program
Accuracy / Error results are also presented in Jupyter files.
