# ANN-LSTM-for-Short-term-Load-Forecasting
This project presents a novel Short Receptive Field based Dilated Causal Convolutional Network Integrated with Bidirectional LSTM (SRDCC-BiLSTM) for Short-term electrical load forecasting. The presented model is compared with various statistical,machine learning and deep learning methods. This repository contains the codes related to this project

Download the ZIP folder from Github repository and extract it.
# For Jupter Notebook Files:
1. Place the extracted folder in the directory of Jupyter notebook.
2. After accessing the Jupyter interface, click on the extracted folder
3. After accessing the folder, two sub-folders will be found. The “Data” folder consists of Electrical Load Dataset.
4. Choose the "Deep Learning Architectures" folder to excute/run for forecasting purposes of different DL architectures.

# For MATLAB Files:
1. Open MATLAB program and place "Plot Aided Files" in MATLAB directory to run matlab files.
2. Run the program
